# ESP32_Bluetooth_WiFi_Scanner
This project allows an ESP32 to scan WiFi networks and connect to one of them, using Bluetooth to receive commands from an external device. Additionally, it can make HTTP requests to retrieve information about South Park episodes from an API and send the data back via Bluetooth.
